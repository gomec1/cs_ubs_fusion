            "In March 2021, Credit Suisse suffered a loss of roughly USD 5.5 billion, triggered by the collapse of Archegos Capital Management. Archegos was a US-based family office—i.e., a private wealth management vehicle for a single high-net-worth individual. Unlike traditional hedge funds, family offices face substantially lighter regulatory requirements, especially regarding transparency and disclosure to markets and supervisors.",
            "Archegos used this structure to build very large, highly leveraged, and highly concentrated equity positions. It did not primarily buy shares outright, but relied on complex instruments known as total return swaps (TRS). This structure made it possible to control economic exposure to shares without being visible as a shareholder.",
            "Credit Suisse served Archegos via its prime services division—the business that provides hedge funds and family offices with financing, derivatives, and clearing services. The Archegos case shows that the loss did not emerge overnight; it was the result of a long, gradual erosion of risk discipline. Warning signals were identified but repeatedly downplayed or not implemented consistently for commercial reasons."

          "id": "hintergrund",
          "title": "Background: Archegos and Credit Suisse",
          "paragraphs": [
            "The relationship between Credit Suisse and Archegos goes back to the early 2000s. As early as 2003, Archegos—then operating under the name Tiger Asia—became a client of the bank. From 2005 onward, Tiger Asia used equity swaps to build equity exposures through Credit Suisse.",
            "After serious allegations of insider trading and market manipulation, Tiger Asia reached a settlement with US authorities in 2012. It was subsequently renamed Archegos Capital Management and continued as a family office. Despite this history, the business relationship remained in place. Internal reputation reviews did not lead to meaningful restrictions, while the bank’s exposure to Archegos continued to grow.",
            "In hindsight, this resembles a gradual normalization effect: a client that generates strong revenues over many years becomes increasingly taken for granted—even if its history and risk profile warrant caution."

        {
          "id": "instrumente",
          "title": "How Archegos built exposure: TRS, bullet swaps, and margining",
          "paragraphs": [
            "To understand the case, it is essential to understand the instruments involved. Total return swaps are contracts under which a bank passes the price performance of a share to a client. The client receives gains and bears losses without owning the share. The bank holds the share on its own balance sheet.",
            "For Archegos, this model offered several advantages. It enabled very large positions with comparatively little equity. It also kept the true scale of its exposures largely invisible to the market. Particularly risky were so-called bullet swaps, where gains and losses are settled only at the end of the term. This allowed positions to be held for long periods and expanded further.",
            "Another crucial point was collateralization. Credit Suisse required Archegos mainly to post a static initial margin. This meant the collateral remained constant in absolute dollar terms even as risk increased significantly due to rising share prices. Dynamic margining—where additional collateral would automatically be required as risk grew—was discussed but not implemented for a long time. In simple terms: risks grew faster than the safety nets."

          "id": "warnsignale",
          "title": "Early signals: warning signs, CPOC, and missed opportunities",
          "paragraphs": [
            "There were clear indications years before the collapse that risks were accumulating. From 2017 onward, internal risk thresholds were repeatedly breached. Instead of using this as a trigger to fundamentally reassess the relationship, the bank repeatedly granted exceptions and transition periods.",
            "A particularly consequential step came in 2019, when required collateral was materially reduced at Archegos’ request. At the same time, position size and concentration continued to increase. Throughout 2020, internal exposure limits were violated almost regularly. Risk management staff repeatedly raised concerns but struggled to enforce them against the front office.",
            "After an earlier loss event, the bank set up a dedicated oversight body—the Counterparty Oversight Committee (CPOC). Archegos was flagged there as a particularly risky counterparty. Yet discussions did not translate into clear consequences. Key decision-makers did not always attend meetings, and accountability was not clearly assumed. Risks were visible—but no one intervened decisively."

          "paragraphs": [
            "When the prices of Archegos’ core stocks deteriorated sharply in March 2021, the situation escalated quickly. Highly leveraged and concentrated positions triggered massive margin calls. Archegos was no longer able to meet the required collateral.",
            "Credit Suisse ultimately declared an event of default—i.e., a formal contractual breach by the client. Large equity positions then had to be sold under severe time pressure. Because multiple banks sold simultaneously and market liquidity was limited, prices fell sharply. While some competitors began block sales early, Credit Suisse hesitated—with significant consequences.",

            "Especially problematic was the extreme concentration in a small number of stocks. In some companies, Archegos held economic stakes representing a significant share of free float. For non-specialists, that means: once these positions had to be sold, even small sell volumes were enough to put massive pressure on prices."

The bank suspended share buybacks, downsized its investment bank, and largely withdrew from the prime services business. Senior managers resigned, and an external investigation found severe shortcomings in risk management.",
            "Market reaction was also sharp. The share price fell, and the cost of hedging against a credit event rose materially. Rating agencies revised Credit Suisse’s outlook to negative, further increasing funding pressure."

            "Alongside Archegos, the Greensill case was one of the two central scandals that durably undermined trust in Credit Suisse. While Archegos was primarily a classic trading and risk-management case, Greensill exposed deep problems in asset management, product control, and the handling of conflicts of interest.",
            "Greensill Capital specialized in supply chain finance, pre-financing suppliers’ invoices and selling the resulting receivables to investors. Credit Suisse packaged these receivables into investment funds and sold them as conservative, short-term investment products.",
            "When Greensill collapsed in early 2021, funds totaling roughly USD 10 billion had to be frozen."

          "paragraphs": [
            "Greensill Capital was founded in 2011 and presented itself as an innovative financial service provider at the intersection of corporates, suppliers, and capital markets. It promised more efficient supply chain financing while offering investors stable returns at low risk.",
            "The relationship with Credit Suisse developed from the mid-2010s onwards. Within the bank, asset management in particular played a central role. Credit Suisse became not only a distribution partner but also a key growth driver for Greensill by enabling access to institutional investors.",
            "Over time, a close economic interdependence emerged: Credit Suisse managed funds that relied almost exclusively on receivables structured by Greensill, provided loans to Greensill itself, and supported strategic projects such as a planned IPO."

          "title": "The supply chain finance business model",
          "paragraphs": [
            "Supply chain finance is, in principle, a simple concept. Suppliers issue invoices to large companies and receive cash earlier when a financial intermediary pre-finances the invoice. In return, investors earn a return that arises from the customer’s later payment.",
            "Important for non-specialists: in its classic form, this model is based on real, short-term invoices from creditworthy companies. The risk is therefore considered limited as long as the debtors pay reliably.",
            "Greensill went a step further. In addition to existing invoices, the company increasingly financed so-called “future receivables”—revenues that were expected to arise only in the future. Economically, these structures resembled less traditional trade finance and more unsecured corporate loans, materially increasing risk."

          "paragraphs": [
            "From 2017, Credit Suisse launched several supply chain finance funds that invested almost exclusively in receivables arranged by Greensill. The funds grew quickly and, by 2020, managed around USD 10 billion for roughly 1,200 professional investors.",
            "The funds were positioned as liquid, low-risk products with short duration. Many investors saw them as an alternative to money market funds. In reality, risk depended heavily on the quality of the underlying receivables, concentration in individual debtors, and the continued validity of credit insurance.",
            "A significant portion of the receivables was insured against default. These policies conveyed additional safety—however, only as long as they actually existed and were renewed."

            "There was also strong dependence on credit insurers. Much of the perceived safety was based on insurance coverage. If it fell away, the funds’ risk profile changed abruptly.",
            "In addition, Credit Suisse relied to a large extent on credit assessments performed by Greensill itself. Independent internal reviews were limited. At the same time, conflicts of interest existed because the bank was both fund provider and lender as well as Greensill’s strategic partner."
